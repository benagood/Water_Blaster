# Water_Blaster
Self aiming water blaster.

This is for a multipurpose self aiming water blaster using a Raspberry Pi and OpenCV.
- The initial intent is to use as a "trainer" to keep chickens off a couple areas of the yard. Unmanned and automated. Gently scare them a few times and chickens know where to not be. They leave droppings everywhere and can be difficult to clean.
- Second use will be as a fun festival water cannon for summer use.
- Other future uses could include a yard/garden water-casting system.
- Ultimately hope to classify and select targets.
